CSS Bootstrap Intro


## Part 1
* Configure a [Bootstrap site in Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thekalinga.bootstrap4-vscode). Use this to create your own file.
* Use as little of your own CSS when possible.  Rely upon Bootstrap's layout tools to do as much of the heavy lift as possible.
* Add a nav bar
* Add a card layout 

## Part 2
* Make the entire card a link
* Add a dropshadow to the card. 
* Show up to 2 columns on small mode, up to 4 columns on medium, and full columns on full-screen.
* Add a page nav below the cards

## Part 3
* Add a form inside a container that includes the users full mailing address.

* Ensure the form aligns well on mobile.
